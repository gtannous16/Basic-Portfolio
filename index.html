        <p> My name is Gabriella Tannous. I was grew up in Sugar Land, Texas. 
            I'm typing whatever right now because I need to focus on the structure of 
            this website before I focus on the content. </p>
        <p>I like chickfil, I had it for lunch. Chicken nuggets are the best. 
            bla bla bla bla...... this is soooo cool ladidadida this is so much 
            work and its scary and i just feel like i'm gonna suck at this but 
            I'm trying to be positive and I know I'll be okay.
