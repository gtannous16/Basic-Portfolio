                    On June 16, 2013, Gabriella married her husband and supported him as he answered his 
                    calling to the Orthodox Christian Priesthood. Since then, they have lived in New York, 
                    and Fort Lauderdale, before finally settling down in Atlanta, Georgia where they 
                    currently live with their adorable dog Kallie!

                    Gabriella loves to be on her computer spending hours geeking out and writing code. 
                    She also loves reading, watching movies, building LEGO’s and has a serious obsession 
                    with Harry Potter!  Being creative and artistic is an enormous passion of hers and 
                    she embraces any chance she’s blessed with to make an idea into a reality!
